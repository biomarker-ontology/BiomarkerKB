v1.1 Release Notes

Data Changes:
- The "main_x_ref" field has been renamed to "assessed_biomarker_entity_ID".
- The "biomarker_status" field has been renamed to "biomarker".
- The "specimen_type" field has been split into "specimen_ID" and "specimen" fields to increase parsability.
- The "condition_name" field has been split into "condition_ID" and "condition" fields to increase parsability.
- The following fields have been added [1]:
    - exposure_agent_ID
    - exposure_agent 
- The "evidence_source" field has been split into "evidence_source" [2] and "evidence" [3] fields to increase parsability.
- The "best_biomarker_type" field has been renamed to "best_biomarker_role".
- Column ordering updated to:
    - biomarker_ID 
    - biomarker 
    - assessed_biomarker_entity
    - assessed_biomarker_entity_ID 
    - assessed_entity_type
    - best_biomarker_role
    - condition 
    - condition_ID 
    - exposure_agent 
    - exposure_agent_ID 
    - specimen 
    - specimen_ID 
    - loinc_code
    - evidence_source 
    - evidence 
    - notes 

Schema Changes:
- "biomarker_ID" set to optional, it will be assigned when the data is incorporated.
- "condition" and "condition_ID" are conditionally required based on the presence of one of the values.
- "exposure_agent" and "exposure_agent_ID" are conditionally required based on the presence of one of the values.
- The pairs of ("condition", "condition_ID") and ("exposure_agent", "exposure_agent_ID") are mutually exclusive, a given record will have either condition or exposure data.
- "specimen" set to optional.
- "specimen_ID" set to optional.
- "loinc_code" set to optional.
- "evidence" set to optional. 

Structure Changes:
- Added ability to add conditional and exclusive requirements.
- Conditionals: Properties that are conditionally required based on the presence of other properties. 
    - Example: In the row for the "condition" property, the property "condition_ID" is set as a conditional requirement. If the "condition" property is included, then the "condition_ID" property is required (and vice versa).
- Exclusions: Properties that are mutually exclusive based on the presence of other properties.
    - Example: In the row for the "condition" property, the properties "exposure_agent" and "exposure_agent_ID" are set as exclusion requirements. If the "condition" property is included, then the "exposure_agent" and "exposure_agent_ID" are not to be included. 

[1]: A given record will have either condition information or expsure_agent information. 
[2]: The evidence_source field will optimally be formatted as Resource:Identifier (e.x. PMID:12345).
[3]: The evidence field would be "some text sentence" and would be populated by manual curation or natural langauge processing (NLP).
