v2.0 Release Notes

Data Changes:
- The "main_x_ref" column has been renamed to "assessed_biomarker_entity_ID".
- The "biomarker_status" column has been renamed to "biomarker".
- The "specimen_type" column has been split into "specimen_ID" and "specimen" columns to increase parsability.
- The "condition_name" column has been split into "condition_ID" and "condition" columns to increase parsability.
- The following columns have been added [1]:
    - exposure_agent_ID
    - exposure_agent 
- The "evidence_source" column has been split into "evidence_source" [2] and "evidence" [3] columns to increase parsability.
- Column ordering updated to:
    - biomarker_ID 
    - biomarker 
    - assessed_biomarker_entity_ID 
    - assessed_entity_type
    - specimen 
    - specimen_ID 
    - loinc_code
    - best_biomarker_type 
    - condition 
    - condition_ID 
    - exposure_agent 
    - exposure_agent_ID 
    - evidence 
    - evidence_source 
    - notes 

Schema Changes:
- Added ability to add conditional and exclusive requirements.
- Conditionals: Properties that are conditionally required based on the presence of other properties. 
    - Example: In the row for the "condition" property, the property "condition_ID" is set as a conditional requirement. If the "condition" property is included, then the "condition_ID" property is required (and vice versa).
- Exclusions: Properties that are mutually exclusive based on the presence of other properties.
    - Example: In the row for the "condition" property, the properties "exposure_agent" and "exposure_agent_ID" are set as exclusion requirements. If the "condition" property is included, then the "exposure_agent" and "exposure_agent_ID" are not to be included. 

[1]: A given record will have either condition information or expsure_agent information. 
[2]: The evidence_source column will optimally be formatted as Resource:Identifier (e.x. PMID:12345).
[3]: The evidence column would be "some text sentence" and would be populated by manual curation or natural langauge processing (NLP).
