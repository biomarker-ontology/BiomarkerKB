The authors stated that men positive for SARS-CoV-2 and on ADT not only had improved outcomes over other men with prostate cancer positive for SARS-CoV-2, but that ADT may have reduced the chance of infection.

In vitro studies showed increased cholinesterase activity in the presence of glucose 5100 mM or insulin 0.525 UI (p < 0.001).

Possibly, a relationship exists between the increase in serum cholinesterase and the vascular complications in the diabetic patients, potentially stimulated by the levels of glycemia and dyslipidemia.

Prognostic analysis of YAP1 demonstrated a significant correlation between mRNA expression level data and reduced overall survival (p = 0.001). In addition, TMA and immunohistochemistry analysis suggested that YAP1 protein expression is an independent predictor of poor overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) 1.870, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.224–2.855, p = 0.004], as well as reduced disease-free survival (HR 1.950, 95% CI 1.299–2.927, p = 0.001). Bioinformatic analyses coupled with in vitro assays indicated that YAP1 is involved in the transcriptional control of target genes, associated with extracellular matrix remodeling, which could be modified by selected substances disrupting the YAP1-TEAD interaction. We demonstrate that YAP1 is an independent prognostic marker associated with recurrence and unfavorable survival in pancreatic cancer. We also show that inhibition of YAP1/TEAD interaction interferes with the expression of AREG, CTGF, CYR61, and MSLN suggesting that YAP1 transcriptional activity may affect the development and persistence of a fibrotic tumor microenvironment.

This suggested that low or absent expression of GKN1 may contribute to gastric carcinogenesis. This is consistent with a previous study that demonstrated decreased GKN1 expression in gastric cancer tissues. In addition, we analysed GKN1 expression in two types of gastric cancer and found that the mRNA level of GKN1 was lower in patients with diffuse type gastric cancer.

Immunohistochemical staining of primary tumor tissues of 137 patients with gastric cancer showed that LC3 and p62/SQSTM1 protein levels were positively correlated with PD-L1 (LC3, p < 0.001; p62/SQSTM1, p < 0.05). The expression of PD-L1 was also positively correlated with tumor lymphocyte infiltration (p < 0.001).

Genes expressed only in cancer tissue, and especially on the cell membrane, will be useful molecular markers for diagnosis and may also be good therapeutic targets. To identify genes that encode transmembrane proteins present in GC, we generated Escherichia coli ampicillin secretion trap (CAST) libraries from two GC cell lines and normal stomach. By sequencing 4320 colonies from CAST libraries, we identified 30 candidate genes that encode transmembrane proteins present in GC. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of these candidates revealed that ZDHHC14, BST2, DRAM2, and DSC2 were expressed much more highly in GC than in 14 kinds of normal tissues. Among these, DSC2 encodes desmocollin 2, which is one of three known desmocollins. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that 22 (28%) of 80 GC cases were positive for desmocollin 2, and desmocollin 2 expression was observed frequently in GC with the intestinal mucin phenotype. Furthermore, desmocollin 2 expression was correlated with CDX2 expression. These results suggest that expression of desmocollin 2, induced by CDX2, may be a key regulator for GC with the intestinal mucin phenotype.
